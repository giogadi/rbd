Ideas:
* Add rotation + rotational velocity
* Add forces/torques
* Add impulses

WOW! Okay so we gotta implement:

* Detection of point-face contact
* Detection of edge-edge contact
* "Find all contact points"
* Find time of collision
* Compute impulse
* Apply impulse to bodies

Nah, let's begin with collision detection then.

If 2 polyhedra are disjoint or contacting (but not penetrating), there exists a separating plane where EITHER:
* the plane contains a face of one of the polyhedra, OR
* the plane contains an edge from one of the polyhedra AND is parallel to an edge of the other polyhedron
    * i.e., the plane's normal is the cross product of 1 edge of one polyhedron and 1 edge of the other polyhedron and contains one of the edges.
Only need to check vertices on either side of the plane (not edges or faces).

When you find a valid sep. plane, it either came from a face or a pair of edges. Choose that face or pair of edges as the "defining face/edges". In following time steps, as long as that sep plane remains valid then def no collision. If it becomes invalid, try again to find a sep plane from scratch. If nothing, then you got a collision, buddy. QUESTION: do we need to store ALL the failing sep planes for collision response? I guess if dt is small, this should usually be a very small set of planes (if > 1 even).

When there's a collision, most of the time it's either:
(a) vertex inside another polyhedron
(b) edge intersecting a face (actually, if (a) is false, then doesn't the intersecting edge always cross _two_ faces?)

Then when checking some earlier time to find the time of collision, can look _first_ at either the vertex from (a) or the edge+face from (b) to have a good chance of getting a fast answer to the question.

So let's break it down. We need:

* get all vertices of a box
* get all faces of a box
* get all edges of a box
* check whether all points of a polyhedron are on one side of a plane. + side or - side?

Yoooo....does it actually work? Feels super expensive doesn't it? Whatever.

So what comes next?
* Tidy a little bit
* Compute time of collision
* Add impulses
* Compute impulses from collision

Okay so shiiiiii you refactored and it doesn't quite work yet. That's ok! We'll get there duder.

YESSSSS it works with the cute lil refactor. Now we're ready to:
(1) clean up commented shit
(2) return defining edges/faces

TIME OF COLLISION

So NOW we have something stupid to work try to iterate on. Now we can probably take a real stab at the time-of-collision calculation. Wait a sec, quick check: how do we get the vertex-face or edge-edge collision from here?

Well, no. Before we proceed to time-of-collision we should maybe be more sure of how we will compute our set of contacts.

......should we just implement GJK? lol.

Kay, we're close now. We should proceed by maybe rendering the face+vertex or edge+edge pair at close collisions to see if they make sense.

Now we gotta compute contact points. Easy for vertex-face, but the hard one might be edge-edge. We need the edge-edge collision _normal_, and we need it to point in a specific direction: away from A.

If the edges are part of 2 polyhedra that are apart, then we should maybe just look for the side that B is on or whatever. ezpz, right?

So NOW we need "closest point on plane" I guess?

Okay: Next, we should implement time-to-collision+contacts!

We have something kinda working but it sometimes doesn't. Let's set up a doesn't-work example and maybe even make some unit tests.

What could we use to debug this?
* iterate by step
* visualize the contact and the normal

Yo. VICTORY. Maybe let's try setting it off in a room and see what happens

NEXT: create a PhysicsScene that owns all the rb's and handles all the pair-wise collision checking.
